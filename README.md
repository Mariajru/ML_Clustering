# Clustering with Machine Learning

Different clustering algorithms were applied to a complex dataset. It is intended to address the issue of clustering in an explanatory and illustrative way. With this purpose, a hand gesture database is used to which different algorithms, K-means, Agglomerative, DBSCAN, and Mean-Shift, are implemented in Python. Additionally, the performance is studied after adding some labels.
