# Clustering with Machine Learning

In this work we are going to present clustering, some of its most important properties and applications. It is intended to address the issue of clustering in an explanatory and illustrative way. For this, the Motion-Capture-Based Hand Gesture Recognition database is used to which different clustering algorithms, K-means, Agglomerative, DBSCAN and Mean-Shift, implemented in Python. On the other hand, we are going to study the performance after adding some labels to the data, in order to deal with the differences with a supervised algorithm.
