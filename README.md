# Clustering with Machine Learning

Different clustering algorithms were applied to a complex dataset. It is intended to address the issue of clustering in an explanatory and illustrative way. With this purpose, a hand gesture database is used to which different algorithms, K-means, Agglomerative, DBSCAN and Mean-Shift, implemented in Python. On the other hand, we are going to study the performance after adding some labels to the data, in order to deal with the differences with a supervised algorithm.
